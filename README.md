# OSU-local-MCM

The [OSU Mathematics Contest in Modeling (MCM)](https://u.osu.edu/careerprep/osu-mcm/) is a competition where a teams of up to three undergraduate students create, analyze, and write a report on a mathematical model for an open-ended real world problem. Faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in mathematics will then judge the reports on merits such as practicality of the model, clarity, and appeal of the report.

This repo contains my team's work for this contest.
